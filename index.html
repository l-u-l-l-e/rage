    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>RAGE is a new global multidisciplinary feminist digital and print zine and platform for expressing feminist rage as a tool for creative change and action.</p>
    <p>We are an inclusive and non-profit feminist platform for expression – one where rage can be set free with vulnerability and dignity. Our zine publishes bold and experimental feminist content (writing, art & more) primarily in English, with an emphasis on multidisciplinarity, harnessing rage as the powerful source of creativity it can be. We also host launch events, workshops, and talks seeking to provide a space for voices that are usually unheard.</p>
    <p>The project is led by the RAGE Collective, a group of young feminist artists, creatives, writers, academics, and activists based around the world but headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

</p> <p> In her art and in life, she is interested in raw emotions, vulnerability, and softness. For her, women’s empowerment, self-agency, and gender equality go hand in hand with these. She finds beauty in the mundane and strives to live a creative, empowered, romantic life. More often than not, she will turn to topics such as heartbreak, existential dread, ecstatic emotions, and vast sadness, rather than rage. As she states herself, she is ‘way too soft for rage.. rage makes me cautious, it reminds me to zoom out and to wonder what lies underneath’. So this should be interesting.</p>

          <p>Lorenza is a PhD Student in Biophotonics from Italy usually based in Copenhagen, but currently living in Boston and completing a visiting fellowship at MIT.</p>
<p>She thinks being a feminist woman in STEM is such a weird experience – apart from the imposter syndrome and the female quotas, STEM is a place where people generally fear or are skeptical about feminism. She’s part of the DTU Feminist Forum Steering Group, where she works with innovative speakers to give inspiring talks followed by open discussions. She’s always produced her most heartfelt art out of anger, and is looking forward to discovering how others create portraits of their rage and what it sparks in them. As Science Editor she’s hoping to find new expressions of feminism and explore the Venn diagram intersection of science, rage and feminism.

Her professional life centres on peace and security and human rights topics, having worked both in NGOs and within EU institutions. Her discussions on feminism across cultures, genders and generations have almost always brought with them anger and frustration from all parties involved – why she’s interested in further exploring why feminism is tied to rage and how this affects wider human rights and political agendas.

She runs the art and sexuality platform, Sexualia, which seeks to expand our understanding of sexuality and ‘un-box’ the world. For her, rage and anger are exciting emotions, a natural part of life, and she would like to explore the spectrum of human emotions more and to normalize feeling what we need to feel and create room to express this. According to her, there is a great vulnerability in showing and sharing one’s feelings – this is a strength.</p>

 <p>RAGE Zine is a global multidisciplinary digital and print zine exploring the theme of feminist rage.</p>
<p>We are looking for submissions of all kinds of writing and art about feminist rage or showcasing feminist rage. Multidisciplinarity is a core value for us, so we are looking for pieces covering a range of topics and disciplines, including politics, literature, art, gender, LGBTQIA+ rights, global health, science, education, psychology, sexuality, visual culture and more. We also publish a range of forms, including but not limited to articles, poems, photography, painting, collage, film stills and digital art.</p>
<p>We particularly encourage submissions to go beyond the obvious scope of theme and are particularly keen on experimental, bold and fresh feminist content.</p>
<p>We are primarily looking for finalized submissions, but very much enjoy co-creating and editing text pieces and helping you shape submissions, so do not hesitate to get in touch if you have an idea and would like some feedback or support creating your piece. We also reach out to select creators for commissioned pieces.</p>

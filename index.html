    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>RAGE is a global multidisciplinary feminist zine and platform—both print and digital—for expressing feminist rage as a force for creative change and collective action.</p>
    <p>100% non-profit, volunteer-driven and inclusive, the platform is a space where rage can be unleashed with vulnerability and dignity. We publish bold, experimental feminist work—writing, art, and more—primarily in English, with an emphasis on multidisciplinarity, harnessing feminist rage as the powerful source of creativity it can be.</p>
    <p>Beyond the page, we also host creative feminist workshops, events and panels that amplify and platform feminist voices and themes that are too often unheard.</p>
    <p>The project is led by the RAGE Collective: a group of feminist artists, writers, academics, creatives, and activists, based around the world, but primarily headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

Her research brings together feminist ideas of embodiment and resistance in 21st century German-language literature.

          <p>Joy is Copenhagen-based Journalist and Cultural Studies student exploring identity, power and embodiment. </p><p>
She's drawn to the stories we inherit, resist, and carve out in the margins. Mixed-raced, neurodivergent, and shaped by years of moving across continents and communities, she brings intersectional perspective to her work in pop culture and media. Navigating institutional spaces and alternative cultural contexts, her approach is grounded in embodied knowledge and refusal to simplify the complexity of lived experience. Alongside rage and critical thinking, she finds clarity and softness in the body and nature to stay porous, attentive, and radically awake.
</p><p> At RAGE, she curates editorial direction for pop culture and news content while creating audio projects. Joy sees narrative storytelling and digital intimacy as tools of resistance — where feminist rage, vulnerability and contradiction coexist.

Her creative work spans visual, digital, and physical arts. She trained as a professional dancer in Malmö and Berlin, and holds a BA in Communication Design. Drawing from her performance and design experience, she continues to explore the intersection of these disciplines through working with set- and stage-design. Her artistic practice centers around the body as a topic and medium, which is also reflected in the ongoing life drawing series “akt” she organizes and facilitates around Berlin.

She is Italian, based in Copenhagen, and she has lived in Utrecht and Milan. She is committed to building safe spaces where people feel seen, comfortable, and heard. In her research, she explores the role of sight and vision in societies, queer and feminist archival methodologies, and the politics of representation. She is also interested in understanding the relationship between space, power, and self-determination, rooted in her experience of growing up as a queer person in a small village. She is a runner, and her hidden passion is trains and undergrounds (they are so fascinating), she loves writing, the color blue, deep conversations, and feels at home near the water.

          <p>Lorenza is an Italian Biophotonics researcher based in Copenhagen. She holds a PhD in the field and previously completed a visiting fellowship at MIT in Boston.</p><p>
She thinks being a feminist woman in STEM is such a weird experience – apart from the imposter syndrome and the female quotas, STEM is a place where people generally fear or are skeptical about feminism. She has been part of the DTU Feminist Forum Steering Group, where she worked with innovative speakers to give inspiring talks followed by open discussions. She’s always produced her most heartfelt art out of anger, and is looking forward to discovering how others create portraits of their rage and what it sparks in them. As Science Editor she’s hoping to find new expressions of feminism and explore the Venn diagram intersection of science, rage and feminism.

          <p>Mathilde works at the EU Commission on peace and security in sub-Saharan Africa and is based in Brussels.</p><p>
Danish and Swiss, she grew up near Copenhagen and did her studies in London, UK. She wrote her undergraduate dissertation on female trauma and the #MeToo movement, and then focused on human rights in conflict and fragile contexts. Her professional life centres on peace and security and human rights topics, having worked both in NGOs and within EU institutions. Her discussions on feminism across cultures, genders and generations have almost always brought with them anger and frustration from all parties involved – why she’s interested in further exploring why feminism is tied to rage and how this affects wider human rights and political agendas.

She lived in Cambridge and NYC for many years, where she was deeply engaged in feminist activism, zine-making, sexual politics and LGBTQ+ rights advocacy. Currently, she works as a Project Manager at UN Women, and serves as Advisor on Diversity, Inclusion, and Youth for a global conference. She founded RAGE Zine as an antidote to feeling silenced within institutional, social and cultural power structures, creating a platform where emotions, particularly feminist rage, are mobilised as a political force rather than dismissed as a liability.</p><p>
Her work is rooted in intersectional justice and liberatory art practices, moving across feminism, sexuality, mixed-race identity, queerness, psychoanalysis, and intergenerational trauma. She loves synchronicities, the colour green, & reading sexy books in public.</p>

She works with existential phenomenology as a therapist, exploring themes such as how do I want to live my life? What is important for me in my life? For the last five years she’s also been working with sexology and sex education. She runs the art and sexuality platform, Sexualia, which seeks to expand our understanding of sexuality and ‘un-box’ the world. For her, rage and anger are exciting emotions, a natural part of life, and she would like to explore the spectrum of human emotions more and to normalize feeling what we need to feel and create room to express this. According to her, there is a great vulnerability in showing and sharing one’s feelings – this is a strength.

When she isn’t reading, writing, or raging, Rosie can be found swimming in the ocean or having a yarn about football, food and feminsísm – the three great loves in her life.</p>

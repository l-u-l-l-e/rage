  <!-- About section -->
  <section class="about" id="about">
    <p>RAGE is a new global multidisciplinary feminist digital and print zine and platform for expressing feminist rage as a tool for creative change and action.</p>
    <p>We are an inclusive and non-profit feminist platform for expression â€“ one where rage can be set free with vulnerability and dignity. Our zine publishes bold and experimental feminist content (writing, art & more) primarily in English, with an emphasis on multidisciplinarity, harnessing rage as the powerful source of creativity it can be. We also host launch events, workshops, and talks seeking to provide a space for voices that are usually unheard.</p>
    <p>The project is led by the RAGE Collective, a group of young feminist artists, creatives, writers, academics, and activists based around the world but headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
